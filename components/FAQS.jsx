            answer:
                "While some results like increased engagement can be seen quickly, building a sustainable pipeline of leads and sales typically takes 1-3 months. This allows us to gather data, refine our strategy, and build momentum for long-term, scalable growth."

            question: "2. How do you measure success and report on it?",
            answer:

            question: "2. How much capital do I need to start trading with your AI strategies?",
            answer:
                "The required capital depends on the specific market and strategy. We always teach and emphasize the principle of risk management, advising traders to start with only what they can afford to lose. Our training covers position sizing and risk management before you ever place a trade."

                "It's highly recommended to have your product catalog (images, descriptions, variants) prepared. This allows us to design and build the store around your actual inventory, leading to a more accurate and effective final product."
        },

            question: "2. Can you customize my store beyond a basic theme?",
            answer:

        },
        {
            question: "2. How is a custom WordPress theme better than using a pre-made theme?",
            answer:
                "Pre-made themes are built for a generic audience and are often bloated with code you don't need, slowing down your site. A custom theme is built exclusively for your brand and goals, resulting in a faster, more secure, and unique website that provides a superior user experience."
        },
        {
            question: `3. What about website security?`,
            answer:
                "Security is a top priority. We implement foundational security best practices during development, including secure login procedures and careful plugin vetting. For ongoing protection, we strongly recommend our Website Care Plan to handle security monitoring, malware scanning, and core updates."
        },
        {
            question: "4. Do you provide hosting for the websites you build?",
            answer:
                "While we don't provide hosting directly, we have strong partnerships with elite, managed WordPress hosting providers. We will provide a clear recommendation based on your traffic and technical needs and can handle the entire setup process for you."

            answer:
                `Our Maintenance Plan is designed to protect your investment. It typically includes regular WordPress core and plugin updates, security monitoring, daily off-site backups, performance optimization, and a quota of support time for small tweaks and issues.

            question: "2. How long does the entire company formation process take?",
            answer:

                 USA LLC: 3-10 business days
                 UK Ltd: 24-48 hours
                 Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd: 10-20 business days

            question: `3. What is the difference between an Active and Inactive Taxpayer in Pakistan, and why does it matter?`,
            answer:
                "An Active Taxpayer is someone who has filed their tax return for the latest tax year. This status is crucial as it avoids a penalty on many financial transactions, makes you eligible for tax refunds, and is often required for government tenders and business licenses."
        },
        {
            question: "4. Do your fees include government charges?",
            answer:
                "Our service fee is separate from mandatory government filing fees. We believe in total transparency. Our initial quote will clearly itemize our professional service fee and the exact government charges so you see the full picture upfront."
